# Introduction To Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an extremely powerful framework for developing Java applications, particularly web apps and microservices. By utilizing a convention-over-configuration approach and an opinionated setup, it is intended to simplify and accelerate the development process. Spring Boot is a framework that builds on top of the famous Spring Framework, leveraging existing features while introducing new capabilities and simplifications.

Spring Boot has the following essential features and benefits:

### 1. Auto Configuration

Spring Boot employs appropriate defaults and configures the application automatically depending on the dependencies existing in the classpath. This removes boilerplate code, eliminates the need for manual configuration, and boosts developer productivity.

### 2. Standalone Applications

Spring Boot enables you to construct independent programs that can be executed using the java -jar command. It comes with an inbuilt servlet container, such as Tomcat or Jetty, which eliminates the need for complicated deployment configurations.

### 3. Spring Boot Starters

Starters are a collection of opinionated dependencies that let you integrate different technologies and frameworks into your Spring Boot application. They offer a uniform and simple approach to add features such as database access, security, messaging, and more.

### 4. Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator has functionality for monitoring and managing your application that are ready for production. It provides endpoints for gathering application metrics, health checks, logging settings, and other features. Actuator is a fantastic tool for monitoring and managing your production application.

### 5. SpringBoot DevTools

DevTools is a useful collection of applications that improve the programming experience. It offers automated programme restarts, live change reloading, and improved error reporting. DevTools aid in the development cycle and increase developer productivity.

### 6. Easy Testing

Spring Boot has a testing framework that makes it easier to write tests for your application. It provides unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing utilities. You may develop thorough tests to check the accuracy of your application with the suitable configuration.

### 7. Dependency Management

Spring Boot handles dependency version management for you, resolving possible conflicts and assuring compatibility. It simplifies dependency management for your project and decreases the chance of dependence-related complications. This is called **Transitive Dependency**.

### 8. Production Ready Defaults

Spring Boot encourages the use of best practises and appropriate defaults when developing strong and secure applications. It sets logical defaults for things like logging, security, and error handling. This guarantees that your application is ready for production right away.

## Conclusion

We will do a lot of manual configuration in the Spring MVC application by adding all the necessary dependencies, configuring Servlet Container (either Tomcat or Jetty) Server, and writing xml configuration for creating beans, nevertheless, Spring Boot simplifies the development process, reduces boilerplate code, and provides a powerful foundation for building scalable and maintainable Java applications.
