# Building an Application with Spring Boot

This module is intended to give you a taste of Spring Boot. If you wish to construct your own Spring Boot-based project,
go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), enter your project information, select your settings, and obtain a
zip file containing a packaged up project.

You will use Spring Boot to create a small web application and add some helpful services to it.

# Prerequisites

* [Java 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or later
* [Maven 3.5+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) or [Gradle 7.5+](https://gradle.org/install/)
* You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
    * Intellij IDEA
    * Spring Tools Suite
    * VSCode

You may either begin from the beginning and complete each step, or you can skip fundamental setup stages that you are
already familiar with. In any case, you will have functional code.

To start from scratch, move on to Starting with Spring Initializr.

## Step1: Starting with Spring Initializr

- Go to https://start.spring.io/. This service gathers all the dependencies required for an application and handles the
  majority of the setup for you.
- Setting up a Spring Project using Spring Initializr http://start.spring.io and select the following options
    - Project as `Maven` or `Gradle`
    - Language as `Java` or `Kotlin`
    - Spring Boot Version as `3.0.7` or _**latest one**_
    - Project Metadata as
        - Group as `com.springcourse`
        - Artifact as `learn-springboot`
        - Name as `learn-springboot`
        - Description can be your choice
        - Package name automatically generated by the tool based on **Group, Artifact**
        - Packaging as `jar`
        - Java version as `17` for now
        - Type "web" into the search box, and we'll obtain **Spring Web** and add it
        - Click the **"Generate"** button to create a project zip file with the basic spring boot application structure
        - And then import the project in your favorite IDE

## Step2: Create a Simple Web Application

Now you can create a web controller for a simple web application under
(/src/main/java/com/springcourse/learnspringboot/HellWorldController.java) shows:

```java
package com.springcourse.learnspringboot;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController // @Controller + @ResponseBody = @RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Welcome to Spring Boot Course!";
    }
}

```

## Observations

1. The class is marked as a **@RestController**, indicating that it is ready to handle web requests using Spring MVC.
2. **@GetMapping** redirects to the helloWorld() function. When called from a browser or the command line, the method
   returns a string "Welcome to Spring Boot Course!".
3. Because **@RestController** mixes **@Controller and @ResponseBody** annotations, HTTP requests return data rather
   than a view.

## Step3: Extend LearnSpringBootApplication class

Spring Initializr generates a basic LearnSpringBootApplication class for you. However, in this situation, it is overly
simplistic. The application class must be modified to reflect the following listing (from *
*src/main/java/com/springcourse/learnspringboot/LearnSpringBootApplication.java**):

```java
package com.springcourse.learnspringboot;

import java.util.Arrays;

import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class LearnSpringBootApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LearnSpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(ApplicationContext context) {
        return args -> {

            System.out.println("Let's have a look at the beans offered by Spring Boot:");

            String[] beanNames = context.getBeanDefinitionNames();
            Arrays.sort(beanNames);
            for (String beanName : beanNames) {
                System.out.println(beanName);
            }

        };
    }

}

```
