# SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol

SOAP, which stands for **S**imple **O**bject **A**ccess **P**rotocol, is an architectural style and communications protocol used in online services to exchange structured data. It was created in the late 1990s and quickly became popular as a method of communication across dispersed computers.

SOAP is a set of standards and protocols based on XML. The primary components of the SOAP architecture are as follows:

1. **Message Format:** SOAP messages are encoded in XML, resulting in a platform-independent and language-neutral data exchange protocol. A SOAP message is made up of an envelope that contains the payload and optional headers. The actual data being transferred is included in the payload.
2. **Protocol Independence:** SOAP messages can be sent using a variety of protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and others. Message headers often specify the underlying protocol utilized for transmission.
3. **Service-Oriented:** SOAP is designed around the concept of services, which expose a set of operations that can be invoked by clients. A service defines a contract specifying the message format, available operations, and their input and output parameters.
4. **Interface Definition:** SOAP services specify their interfaces using Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML-based language that specifies the accessible operations, their input/output message formats, and the location of the service.
5. **Standardized Protocols:** SOAP relies on various standardized protocols for different purposes. The most commonly used protocol is the SOAP over HTTP, where SOAP messages are transmitted using HTTP as the underlying protocol. Other protocols, such as SOAP over SMTP or SOAP over TCP, can also be used based on the specific requirements.
6. **Support for Advanced Features:** SOAP supports features like security, reliability, and transactional through extensions and additional standards. For example, WS-Security provides mechanisms for message-level security, while WS-ReliableMessaging ensures reliable message delivery.

SOAP is regarded as more heavyweight and sophisticated than REST owing to its significant usage of XML and support for additional capabilities. It is commonly utilised in corporate settings where system interoperability and sophisticated functionality are critical. However, due to their simplicity and interoperability with web-based technologies, RESTful designs and APIs have acquired increasing appeal in recent years.

It is important to note that the decision between SOAP and REST is determined by the application's unique requirements as well as the current infrastructure. Both designs have advantages and disadvantages and are appropriate for different use cases.
