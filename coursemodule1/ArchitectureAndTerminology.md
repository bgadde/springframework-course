# Architecture of Spring Framework

The primary goal behind the development of Spring Framework was to provide a one-stop shop where you could connect and use modules based on your application's needs. Spring's modularity is related to the architecture of Spring. The Spring framework has roughly 20 modules that are utilised depending on the nature of the application.

The Spring Framework architectural diagram is shown below. As you can see, all of the modules are specified on top of the Core container. This layered design includes all of the modules that a developer may need while creating an enterprise application. Furthermore, the developer is able to select or delete any modules that are required or are not required. Because of its modular nature, Spring Framework can simply be integrated with other frameworks.
